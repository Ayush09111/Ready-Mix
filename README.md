# Ready-Mix
This project aims to develop an integrated ERP and Job Cart system for managing end-to-end operations of a Ready-Mix Concrete (RMC) company. The system will streamline customer orders, production batching, dispatch logistics, inventory control, billing, and job status tracking through a centralized software platform.
