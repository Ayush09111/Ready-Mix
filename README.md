This project aims to develop an integrated ERP and Job Cart system for managing end-to-end operations of a Ready-Mix Concrete (RMC) company. The system will streamline customer orders, production batching, dispatch logistics, inventory control, billing, and job status tracking through a centralized software platform. It aims to reduce manual workload, eliminate errors, and enhance real-time decision-making in RMC operations.
